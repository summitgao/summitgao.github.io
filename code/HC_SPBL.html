<b><em>Abstract: </em></b> 
Hyperspectral imagery has evident advantages for sea ice
classification due to enormous spectral bands. In this paper,
we proposed a novel sea ice classification framework from hyperspectral image based on self-paced boost learning (SPBL).
First, the criterion of linear prediction error is used for unsupervised band selection. Then, local binary pattern (LBP) features are extracted from the selected bands. Finally, SPBL is
employed as the classifier to provide probability outputs using
the extracted features. The proposed framework can capture
the intrinsic inter-class discriminative models while ensuring
the reliability of the samples involved in learning. The experimental results in real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework is superior to several closely related methods
