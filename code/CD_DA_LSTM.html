<b><em>Abstract: </em></b> 
Polar sea ice change detection is important for navigation safety and has drawn
great attentions in recent years. In this letter, distinctive analysis and long shortterm memory (LSTM) are integrated to solve problem of the sea ice change detection
for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Firstly, the distinctive analysis algorithm
is utilized to refined the difference image generated by the log-ratio operator. Then,
from the refined difference image, reliable samples are selected to train the LSTM
network. The LSTM network is driven to learn the change information, and a powerful model is built to distinguish changed pixels from noisy background polluted
by the speckle noise. Finally, pixels from the original SAR images are classified into
changed or unchanged class by the LSTM network, and the final change map can
be obtained. Experimental results on two real SAR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over three closely related methods.
