Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree form the School of Big Data & Software Engineering, Chongqing University in 2008. I received my Ph. D. degree from the school of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, under supervision of Prof. [Bo Li](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/5211.htm) in 2015.

My research interests include remote sensing image processing (e.g., change detection, classification), visual computing (e.g., large-scale search, image understanding) and robust deep learning (e.g., adversarial attack/defense, few shot learning).
